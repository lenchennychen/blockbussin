first of all the draw game function was probably the most illegible code i read this year. i figured it out but next time at least add comments?

i centered the floor at 0,0,0 and the field goes from 0~20 on both x and z directions to make it easier to implement the collision detection grid.
i changed the inital camera location as well

i had to change the whole entire drop block function because it was way too buggy and didn't account for how the 4 different cubes of each block have its own position.
i also didn't see a way how collision detection would work w that so i hope whoever first implemented that doesnt mind.

i translated the inital y position upwards so that we didn't have to worry abt the block hitting any of the blocks on the bottom (avoid extra collision detection).

i changed a bunch of other things as well but didn't comment heavily so if you guys read the code and don't understand anything just lmk

Things left to do:
1. clear rows (easy, just fix y coord and check if grid is nonnegative)
1-1. keep track of score (base off of clear rows)
2. choose better colors/shading scheme for blocks 
3. draw outline of where block will drop (I think this will be kinda hard but i separated my code to hopefully make reusing code for this purpse easier. see getBlockCoords function and how its called in other functions)
4. game over function (just check if y component in drop block function exceeds 9)
5. move camera around

3 and 5 are definitely imo the hardest parts so if you feel like you owe the team more work do that.


also i think its good practice not to push super buggy code without comments or at least an explanation on how its supposed to work
