How se0ngbin thinks we should do stuff:

10x10 grid, so we need 100 queues --> https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-queue/
Game over when length of one queue exceeds a certain number

Store queues in 10x10 array named occupied[][]

let final_transf = 1000000; // just some huge number
for each cube in tetris block
	if not on "bottom" <=> there is cube w same x,z coordinates but lower y coordinate
		break;
	else
		new_y = length of occupied[x][z]
		new_transf = distance of cube's y to new_y
		if (final_transf < new_transf)
			final_transf = new_transf;
	
translate block by final_transf in y direction
push 0's and 1's appropriately to queues --> idea: just use final coordinates of block
											--> we then need to make edge of grid at (0,0,0) to make it easier
store block data (final transformation matrix, color) somewhere
